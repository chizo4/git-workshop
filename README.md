1. **Check for Pre-installed Git**:
   - Open the terminal and type:
     ```shell
     git --version
     ```
   - If a version appears, `Git` is already installed on your machine.

2. **Install `Git` (if not already installed)**:
   - Download `Git` from [this website](https://git-scm.com/download).
   - Ensure to select the correct OS and the latest version.

#### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Create a `GitHub` Account
1. **Sign Up**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and follow the link to start a free account.
   - Follows the steps, i.e. provide basic information (name, email, etc.).
   - NB: Students can often get a `PRO account` free of charge.

#### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Connect `GitHub` to Your Machine
1. **Set `Git` Credentials**:
   - Open your terminal and set your Git credentials:
     ```shell
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     ```
     ```shell
     git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
     ```
   - Verify the setup by running:
     ```shell
     git config --list
     ```
2. **SSH Key Setup**:
   - Navigate to your SSH directory with:
     ```shell
     cd ~/.ssh
     ```
   - Check for existing SSH keys (don't worry if some commands look complicated):
     ```shell
     (ls id_rsa && ls id_rsa.pub) && echo yes || echo no
     ```
   - If you don‚Äôt have the SSH keys (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`), generate them with:
     ```shell
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
     ```shell
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com), click on `‚ÄúAccount Settings‚Äù` ‚û°Ô∏è `‚ÄúSSH Keys‚Äù`.
   - Add a label for your key (e.g., `‚ÄúMy MacBook‚Äù`) and paste the copied key.
   - Confirm the setup by running:
     ```shell
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - You should see a message confirming that you've successfully authenticated.
